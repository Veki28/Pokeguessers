### Bugs / issues

- Repeating merge conflicts between separate forks, main repo and git issues overall (solved eventually thanks to Martin)
- To avoid further issues we've decided to separate css and js files for each of the pages to keep it more simple per page. This enabled us to catch things getting out of hand faster and not messing up other parts of pages
- An issue where at 968px width cards would show up as one per row and then at 768px would go back to 2 per row
- Fixed touch not working on mobile devices by commenting out one of media query's
- Fixed sidebar not working properly
- Fixed main heading not displaying properly on mobile
- Fixed an issue where question and score would continue past the set limit meaning the quiz couldn't end

### Homepage Taglines

- "Ready to check your pokemon knowledge with our quiz?"
- "Think you know every pokemon from generation 1? Think again! (you probably don't)

### Future Improvments

- add levels to the quiz which users can progress through
- we'd like to add pokemon types quiz which challanges users knowledge of pokemon types
- implement submiting the username to the site (username would be displayed across pages)
- provide users with better quiz results feedback (eg. summary of quiz questions and answers provided)
- reward users with badges (displayed via html upon completion of quiz levels)
- more variation in available quizes
- overall improvments to styling and site
  
- user profile page/login (further away)
- add leaderboards, so other people could see who did better (further away)
